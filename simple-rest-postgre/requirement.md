**Project: Task Manager with PostgreSQL**

**Requirements:**

1. Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
2. Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
3. Express, Sequelize, pg.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize Your Project:**
   Create a new directory for your project and run the following commands to set up your Node.js project:

   ```bash
   mkdir task-manager-postgres
   cd task-manager-postgres
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the necessary dependencies for your project, including Express.js for creating the server, Sequelize for interacting with PostgreSQL, and the `pg` library for PostgreSQL support.

   ```bash
   npm install express sequelize pg
   ```

3. **Set Up the Server:**
   Create a basic Express.js server in an `app.js` file. Set up routes to handle CRUD operations for tasks.

4. **Database Setup:**
   Create a PostgreSQL database either locally or on a cloud platform like Heroku, and note down your database connection URL.

5. **Create Task Model:**
   Define a Task model using Sequelize to structure the data in your PostgreSQL database.

6. **Initialize Sequelize:**
   Configure Sequelize to connect to your PostgreSQL database using the connection URL from step 4.

7. **Implement Routes:**
   Create routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. Map these routes to appropriate controller functions.

8. **Controller Functions:**
   Implement controller functions to handle the logic for CRUD operations on tasks. These functions should interact with your PostgreSQL database using Sequelize.

9. **Testing:**
   Test your API using tools like Postman or by creating a simple front-end interface with HTML and JavaScript to send HTTP requests to your server.

10. **Error Handling and Validation:**
    Implement error handling and input validation to make your application more robust.

11. **Deployment:**
    If you're ready, consider deploying your application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.

12. **Documentation:**
    Write documentation for your API, including endpoints, request and response formats, and usage examples.

13. **Extras:**
    If you want to enhance your project further, consider adding features like user authentication, task categories, due dates, or notifications.

By adapting your project to use PostgreSQL, you'll gain experience with relational databases and SQL queries in addition to the backend development skills you learned in the previous MongoDB-based version. This project will provide valuable experience in building a Node.js backend with a different database technology.
